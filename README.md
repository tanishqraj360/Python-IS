# Python-IS-Sem1
All Python Codes for 1st Semester for VTU colleges.
Use the codes as refernce or do try to understand the following codes.



E1 - a. Develop a program to read the student details like Name, USN, and Marks in three subjects. Display 
the student details, total marks and percentage with suitable messages. 
b. Develop a program to read the name and year of birth of a person. Display whether the person is a 
senior citizen or not. 



E2 - a. Develop a program to generate Fibonacci sequence of length (N). Read N from the console. 
b. Write a function to calculate factorial of a number. Develop a program to compute binomial 
coefficient (Given N and R). 



E3 - Read N numbers from the console and create a list. Develop a program to print mean, variance and 
standard deviation with suitable messages. 



E4 - Read a multi-digit number (as chars) from the console. Develop a program to print the frequency of 
each digit with suitable message.



E5 - Develop a program to print 10 most frequently appearing words in a text file. [Hint: Use dictionary with distinct words and their frequency of occurrences. Sort the dictionary in the reverse order of 
frequency and display dictionary slice of first 10 items] 



E6 - Develop a program to sort the contents of a text file and write the sorted contents into a separate text 
file. [Hint: Use string methods strip(), len(), list methods sort(), append(), and file methods open(), 
readlines(), and write()].



E7 - Develop a program to backing Up a given Folder (Folder in a current working directory) into a ZIP 
File by using relevant modules and suitable methods. 



E8 - Write a function named DivExp which takes TWO parameters a, b and returns a value c (c=a/b). Write 
suitable assertion for a>0 in function DivExp and raise an exception for when b=0. Develop a suitable 
program which reads two values from the console and calls a function DivExp. 



E9 - Define a function which takes TWO objects representing complex numbers and returns new complex 
number with a addition of two complex numbers. Define a suitable class ‘Complex’ to represent the 
complex number. Develop a program to read N (N >=2) complex numbers and to compute the addition 
of N complex numbers.



E10 - Develop a program that uses class Student which prompts the user to enter marks in three subjects and 
calculates total marks, percentage and displays the score card details. [Hint: Use list to store the marks 
in three subjects and total marks. Use __init__() method to initialize name, USN and the lists to store 
marks and total, Use getMarks() method to read marks into the list, and display() method to display the 
score card details.]
